# -Pitch-Accent-Guide
A Japanese Pitch Accent Guide written in the delirious heat of summer with a broken AC unit. 


This is the condensed information primarily from https://www.youtube.com/c/SeizeJapanese please check out this channel if you have the time, especially if you are a newer learner. I have adapted this information to be more quickly consumable for intermediate+

This entails but is not limited to:
Exclusively beginner oriented content
Readily available knowledge
Single use rules and examples

In the end this is my personal judgment and you may find that some things detailed here are not described sufficiently. If this is the case, please check out the linked channel. The Youtube channel owner very often graciously responds to viewer questions, but please be polite when asking. 

  Section 1 keijo (係助): 
平板 noun + より、さえ、すら、まで、しか、やら、のみ、ごと、など、こそ、とか (2 kana 係助) the two kana will become 頭高 [1] accent.
Example:
「それより」

(Note Streamable links will auto loop if viewed directly on the site!)

But, please note the exception of から、 ほど which are 平板,  and だけ which maintains 尾高.
Example:
「だけど」

Section 2 Adjectives:
らしい appended to nouns has the effect of creating multiple valid pitches for the same words. They have the option of making 頭高 nouns flat, so 兄らしい can either maintain a 頭高 [1] pattern with an optional very slight drop in pitch for the last 拍, or it could be transformed into a 中高 [4] pattern word. (The attached らしい is pattern [2] and attached to the noun. You can view this in a similar manner to verb stem pitch interaction.) If you're speaking, pick one and try to be consistent.

くらい/ぐらい is the same as らしい when attached to nouns, but the attached くらい/ぐらい becomes pattern [1] when attached. 兄ぐらい is now either pattern [1] or [3].

平板 adjectives 赤い will be read by some people as 中高 despite actually being 平板, but if connected to a noun it should always be the flat reading. 

Text example:
The 重い in 重い蓋が割れた should not drop. The speaker may choose to drop slightly after the adjective, but not during the adjective itself. If the noun has any accent, the adjective portion should still be kept flat. This is why dictionary entries for more common compound words like 貰い物 are 平板. 

Video example:
「貰い物 」 (can hear the drop in だけど [2] again)

When a character shouts 「おもい！」 can often have an accent [2], but this is due to the last beat being a sentence ending 拍. This will be explained in more detail below. 

Section 3 "Grouping":
On groups of words: i.e. 君の名は can often be read as a group. Remember for everything that follows that this is not a rule that it must always be read this way, but it happens very often. Both are 平板 and are often (but not always) read together in one string, with the pitch dropping on the last 拍 of the sentence. This drop is not as big as other 起伏 words (any word with an accent) but is still present. If it is not present, to native speakers it can sound like a question. This confusion happens because the last 拍 at the sentenceis supposed to drop slightly and many speakers have a very gentle sentence end inflection when asking a question. If the phrase is being read slow, dropping of pitch between きみの and なは may be acceptable, but to most native speakers it will sound like 君の縄. 
Example of grouping:
「一緒に表示される」

When a 平板 word is followed by a 中高  i.e. 胃が痛い the pitch will drop on the last 拍 making this group a pattern [4] accent and there often no drop in pitch between the words.
Example:
「気が晴れる」

This is very ordinary and might even be expected by learners, but is worth mention because the rule also applies to 尾高 word endings as well. This means pitch will still drop on the last 拍 making the 時 in その時 appear to be 頭高 but this is not because 時 has two pitch accents, the phrase is simply being read as a singular idea/noun and the drop is taking place on the last 拍. Phrases like this one can still be broken up, and there can be a slight drop between the two words, but just expect to hear it the aforementioned way more often than not. 
Example: 
「発現した時」

When any of the various particle enders are present, the sentence ending dip does not occur on that beat (because it's no longer the last one) and sentence ending 平板 words are read according to their dictionary form. The logical extension of this principle is for 尾高 words. Where there is no sentence ending particle the slight pitch drop will take place on the last 拍. 

Section 4: Closing reminders for "Grouping": 
Remember this pattern only occurs when the accented word is last in a group. So, the following naturally has a drop after the adjective. 
Example:
「弱い自分を」

Helper verbs which drop that follow groups will still drop as always.
「気が回らなくて」
Example: https://streamable.com/darj2i


尾高 + の is more well known, but I will include it here just in case, it isn't ironclad but for most 尾高 words which are followed by the particle の there is no drop. 
Example:
「休みの日」

追伸～ 全部の例はダンまち第5話から来たんだ！
It's all fairly common.
